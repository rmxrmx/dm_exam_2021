    Remember to focus on a research question - something you want to address with your study, be it a problem or a question, but something you want to investigate with your study and try to answer or solve. This will guide your writing and literature search tremendously. 
    This is the most important aspect of writing this abstract and getting started on your exam paper, so give it some good thinking (and maybe even a few tries).
	
    Try (hard) to motivate your study independently of the "original" study (if there is such a one) - think of Josh' inequality-paper as a good example: so don't say "this study did this and this, now I'll tweak it a bit in order to test this and that"; instead say something along the lines of e.g. "more inequality leads to less money on social welfare; lab research suggests that simulated inequality affects cooperative decision making; can we link lab behavior to real-world inequality? This study addresses this question by ..." (paraphrasing Josh here)
	
    Remember to think about integrating some sort of (formal) model of decision making into your analysis.



avg_time_per_round = avg time all the participants (60) took to make a decision over 40 rounds. Both configurations combined (they didn't have much differences, between them), so avg(120) x 40 data points.

avg_time_per_subject = 
participant #54 takes an avg of 44 secs to make a decision
participant #27 takes an avg of 13 secs to make a decision


if i want to see the profit in the plot, need to normalize to 0- (doesnt work)


time taken correlates negatively with profit -> more confident people know the game better (know what to do), get more profit
